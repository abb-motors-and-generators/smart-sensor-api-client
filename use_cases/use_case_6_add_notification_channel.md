# Use Case 6: Add Notification Channel

This code demonstrates how to add a notification channel to a specific asset.

If you have not configured your credentials in the `settings.yaml` file in the root folder,
the program will ask you to input your username, password, or API key.

To run the code, execute:

    python use_case_6_add_notification_channel.py <ASSET ID LIST> -nt <NOTIFICATION TYPE> -nc <NOTIFICATION CHANNEL> -u <URL>
    
For example, to configure the cloud such that the assets 1234 and 4567 are sending a webhook notification (notification channel 3) to https://webhook.site/bcf22b9e-9a30-45c2-890b-a9b948XXXXXX if a new measurement was loaded (notification type 13), you can type:
    
    python use_case_6_add_notification_channel.py 1234 4567 -nt 13 -nc 3 -u https://webhook.site/bcf22b9e-9a30-45c2-890b-a9b948XXXXXX
